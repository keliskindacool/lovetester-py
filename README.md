### the love tester
this is a very simple CLI love tester written in python, inspired by the old love tester sites people used some 10 years ago and maybe even now. i originally made this 2 years ago but i decided to fix it just now. and the fix was really simple.
whatever the case, it works now and that's all that matters.

## features
- randomly generates a percentage after taking the names of two people. the percentage is meant to represent the likelihood of those two people entering a relationship.
- that's it
